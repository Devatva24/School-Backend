# School Management System Backend

A **Spring Boot REST API** for managing schools, students, and their profiles. Built with **Java 17**, **Spring Boot 3**, **Spring Data JPA**, and **PostgreSQL** (configurable). Includes DTO mapping, service-layer architecture, and sample tests.

---

## ✨ Features

* CRUD operations for **Schools** and **Students**
* DTO-based request/response models
* Entity-to-DTO mapping with **MapStruct**
* Service/Repository layered architecture
* Exception handling with meaningful error messages
* Unit and integration tests (JUnit 5)
* Postman collection for easy API testing

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

* **Java 17**
* **Spring Boot 3**
* **Spring Web**
* **Spring Data JPA**
* **MapStruct**
* **PostgreSQL** (or H2 for in-memory)
* **Lombok**
* **JUnit 5**, **Mockito**
